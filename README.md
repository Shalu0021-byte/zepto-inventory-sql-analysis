# Zepto Inventory Dataset Analysis (SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a real-world **Zepto inventory dataset** using SQL.  
I performed data cleaning, exploratory queries, and business insights to help optimize inventory and revenue.

## ⚙️ Key Steps
- Removed invalid rows (MRP = 0, missing values).  
- Converted price values from paise to rupees.  
- Checked stock availability and duplicate products.  
- Created SQL queries for:
  - Top discounted products  
  - Out-of-stock high MRP products  
  - Revenue per category  
  - Inventory weight per category  
  - Price per gram analysis  

## 📂 Files
- `zepto.sql` → All SQL queries and cleaning steps.  
- `dataset.csv` → The dataset (if shareable).  
- `screenshots/` → Query results and outputs.  

## 🚀 Results
- Identified categories contributing highest revenue.  
- Classified inventory into **Low, Medium, Bulk** weight groups.  
- Analyzed stock-out trends for high-value products.  

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)  
- GitHub (for project version control & sharing)
